Assignment 3

to compile file
go to the directory (PDYSHA009_A3) in the terminal and type make
to run the file type ./huffencode <inputfile> <outputfile>

NB there is a test version in the make file that runs the program on a sample text file (input.txt)
and outputs it to output.hdr and output.bin

given below:
./huffencode "input.txt" "output"

The program outputs the string of bit directions for the tree into the output file based on the codes in output.hdr
which contains the code table.
